					DM: Are you sure you want to touch that?<br>
					Fighter: Yes, yes I am.<br>
					Cleric: Oh no you aren't!<br>
					Fighter: But why not?<br>
					Cleric: You don't even know where that's been!<br>
					Wizard: ...or if it is magically protected.<br>
					Bard: You're all a bunch of party-poopers, I say let him do what he wants!<br>
					Fighter: Yeah! Let me pick it up!<br>
					DM: Does anyone try to stop him?<br>
					Cleric: I try to grapple the Fighter.<br>
					DM: OK make a strength check.<br>
					Cleric: *rolls 1d20+1: 3<br>
					Cleric: No!<br>
					Wizard: Uh oh!<br>
					Bard: Yeah baby!<br>
					Fighter: Hahaha! I laugh at your puny arms and pick up the artifact!<br>
					Cleric: ...<br>
					DM: ...<br>
					DM: Nothing happens.<br>
					Fighter: Really, nothing? Then why'd you make a big deal about not touching it?<br>
					DM: Oh you'll see.<br>
					Bard: Well that's not ominous or anything...<br>
					Cleric: Wait, wasn't it in the gelatinous cube earlier?<br>
					Fighter: What even is this thing anyways?<br>
					DM: It appears to be a small cube of some sort, with some small buttons on one side.<br>
					Wizard: Do the buttons have any sort of markings?<br>
					DM: Yes, make a history check.<br>
					Wizard: *rolls 1d20+7: 22<br>
					DM: You remember seeing these types of symbols in some books on the ancient empire.<br>
					Wizard: Do they look like the symbols on the note we got earlier?<br>
					DM: Yes, they do!<br>
					Bard: Aha! I press the buttons in the sequence found on the note.<br>
					DM: The cube opens up and releases a horrid smelling substance on you.<br>
					Bard: Agh! This is the second time this week that I'll be washing this!<br>
					DM: You hear slurping sounds from the next hallway... a lot of slurping.<br>
